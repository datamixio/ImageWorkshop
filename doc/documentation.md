# ImageWorkshop

## Documentation

Learn and understand the layer notion and discover all the tools of ImageWorkshop.

If you don't want to read the documentation and want directly to play with ImageWorkshop, just read the "Good practices" chapter (5), it is really important and can avoid some bugs.

### 1. Layer notion

Understand the layer notion: use ImageWorkshop as a layer, a group or a document. Superimpose some layers in the stack of a document...

* [Introduction](documentation/introduction.md)
* [Layer](documentation/layer.md)
* [Group](documentation/group.md)
* [Document](documentation/document.md)
* [Surperimposition & levels](documentation/surperimposition-levels.md)
* [Access to a sublayer](documentation/access-sublayer.md)
* [Merging layers](documentation/merging-layers.md)

### 2. Initialization of a layer

Different ways to initialized a layer: by creating a new layer, from an image variable, from an existant image file...

* [New virgin layer](documentation/virgin-layer.md)
* [From an image file](documentation/from-image-file.md)
* [Resource variable ($image)](documentation/resource-variable.md)
* [Uploaded image file from a form](documentation/uploaded-image.md)
* [Initializing a text layer](documentation/initializing-text-layer.md)

### 3. Manage the result

You can save the result as an image file in a specified folder, or just show it in the navigator...

* [Getting the image variable](documentation/getting-image-variable.md)
* [Showing](documentation/showing.md)
* [Saving](documentation/saving.md)

### 4. Actions on layers

Discover all usefull actions that can be applied on a layer object.

* [Cropping](documentation/cropping.md)
* [Filter](documentation/filter.md)
* [Flip](documentation/flip.md)
* [Opacity](documentation/opacity.md)
* [Resizing](documentation/resizing.md)
* [Rotating](documentation/rotating.md)
* [Writing](documentation/writing.md)

### 5. Good practices

Avoid somes bugs and learn best pratices to optimize the performance of the class !

* [Cloning an ImageWorkshop object](documentation/cloning-imageworkshop-object.md)

### 6. Reference

Reference book: resume of methods, options, etc...

* [List of methods](documentation/list-of-methods.md)
* [Corners / positions schema of an image](documentation/corners-schema-image.md)

You can now pratice with some [tutorials](tutorials.md), and discover the possibilities that ImageWorskhop offers. If you have a problem, don't forget to ask question on [Github](https://github.com/Sybio/ImageWorkshop/issues) !
